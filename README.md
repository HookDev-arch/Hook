## Installation

### Installation via script (recommended)
For a quick and easy installation, run the following command from under **root** and follow the instructions of the installer:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HookDev-arch/Hook/refs/heads/master/install.sh && chmod 777 install.sh && ./install.sh
```

### Manual installation (without script)
If you prefer to install the Hook manually:

```bash
apt update && apt install git libcairo2 -y && git clone https://github.com/HookDev-arch/Hook && cd Hook && pip install -r requirements.txt && python3 -m hook --root
```

- If you are using a VPS/VDS, add `--proxy-pass` to the end of the command to open an SSH tunnel to the Hook web interface.
- To configure it in the console without a web interface, use `--no-web'.

### Installation Details
- **Web interface**: After launching with `--proxy-pass`, you will receive a link for configuration via the browser (for example, `https://<unique-id>.lhr.life`).
- **QR Code**: To log in, scan the QR code via Telegram on your device.
